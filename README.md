MSI Harvest
===

MSIHarvest is a tool for collecting email signups at conferences and shows
where network connectivity is not a guarantee.  Harvest simply collects
personal information to a text file, then will sync to a server when 
connected to a network.  

Sync currently is not written. 

Harvest supports a 'kiosk' mode that is full screen and has no context 
menu, as well as an 'administrator' mode that allows for syncing and 
cleaning up of records.
